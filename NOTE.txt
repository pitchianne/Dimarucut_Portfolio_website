Good evening sir, hopefully I made it before the deadline. I did all as instructed po however yung space ko for ARC hasn't processed yet and it has been hours na po so borrowed muna po from a classmate as a placeholder and update nalang sa GITHUB once mine is processed. Hope you understand po. (here's the link to my matterport space: https://my.matterport.com/models/REj1aXP6uUa?section=media&organization=e2pGoMnUpFp)
